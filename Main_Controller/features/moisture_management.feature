Scenario Outline: Moisture level <scenario_name>
    Given an intelligent vase which is ready to manage soil moisture
    And the vase holds a <plan_type>
    And that plant requires <optimal_level> as a moisture level
    When <average_moisture_level> is reached
    Then <expected_action> should have happened in the next 5 seconds
